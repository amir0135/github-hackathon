# 🔌 MCP Hackathon Track

Master the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** in GitHub Copilot to safely use tools, browse, and work across services from right inside Copilot Chat.

---

## 🤔 What Is MCP (and Why It Matters)

MCP is a protocol that lets language models reliably use tools and keep context over time. With MCP, assistants can:

- ✅ Use tools and services (e.g., Azure, GitHub, browser automation)
- ✅ Maintain persistent state and memory between turns
- ✅ Reason across sessions and invoke functions dynamically
- ✅ Coordinate multiple tools predictably and securely

**Why MCP?** Traditional request/response APIs weren't designed for multi-turn reasoning or tool orchestration. MCP fills that gap with a stateful, extensible protocol tailored to AI assistants and copilots.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

- **MCP Server:** A packaged tool provider (e.g., Azure MCP, GitHub MCP, Playwright MCP)
- **Tool:** A concrete capability exposed by a server (e.g., list resource groups, fetch PRs, navigate pages)
- **State/Memory:** Servers can preserve context to enable multi-step workflows
- **Routing:** Copilot selects and sequences tools to achieve your goal

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

- VS Code with the GitHub Copilot Chat extension (latest recommended)
- Internet access and sign-in to required services
- Optional per-tool setup:
	- **Azure:** `az` CLI and an authenticated session
	- **GitHub:** Signed into GitHub in VS Code with appropriate repo/org access
	- **Playwright:** Browser install handled by the MCP server (will prompt if needed)

---

## 📦 Install and Enable MCP Servers

### Step 1: Install MCP Servers from Marketplace

1. Open the Extensions view in VS Code
2. Search for `@mcp`
3. Install the servers you need:
	 - **Azure (MCP)**
	 - **GitHub (MCP)**
	 - **Playwright (MCP)**

### Step 2: Enable Tools in Copilot

1. Open Command Palette → **"GitHub Copilot: Manage MCP Tools"**
2. Check the tools you want to expose to Copilot Chat:
	 - Azure
	 - GitHub
	 - Playwright

## ✔️ Verify Your Setup

### Azure
- Ensure you're logged in:
	```powershell
	az login
	```
- In Copilot Chat, type `@azure` and confirm suggestions appear

### GitHub
- Ensure VS Code is signed into GitHub with access to your repos
- In Copilot Chat, type `@github` and confirm suggestions appear

### Playwright
- In Copilot Chat, type `@playwright` (or `@browser`) and confirm suggestions appear
- If prompted to install browsers, follow the on-screen steps

## 🚀 Quickstart Exercises

Try these prompts directly in Copilot Chat after enabling the corresponding tools.

1) Azure: List resource groups and regions
- Prompt: “@azure Generate a table listing all my resource groups along with their corresponding regions.”
- If you see a login prompt, complete `az login` and retry.

2) Azure: Cost insight
- Prompt: “@azure What was my most expensive resource last month?”

3) GitHub: Recent commits
- Prompt: “@github List the last 10 commits in kostinams/github-copilot-use-cases.”
	- Replace with your repo if needed, e.g., `owner/repo`.

4) Browser (Playwright): Navigate and extract info
- Prompt: “@playwright Navigate to Yahoo Finance and find MSFT stock price.”

5) Azure Docs Q&A
- Prompt: “@azure In which Azure regions is the gpt-5 model available?”

6) Multi-tool workflow: Read, summarize, and save
- Prompt: “Find the AI landing zone document, read it, summarize it, and store it in a Markdown file under the docs folder.”
	- Copilot may use browsing to find and read the document, then create a summary file in `docs/`.

## 💡 Tips and Best Practices

- **Name the tool:** Start prompts with `@azure`, `@github`, or `@playwright` to nudge the right server
- **Be specific:** Include repo names, resource groups, or page targets to reduce ambiguity
- **Iterate:** Ask follow-ups like "filter to prod only" or "save output to docs/summary.md"
- **Least privilege:** Enable only the MCP tools and scopes you need for your task
- **Secrets & auth:** Don't paste secrets into chat. Use `az login` for Azure and VS Code GitHub sign-in for GitHub
- **Traceability:** For impactful actions (e.g., creating files), ask Copilot to show what it plans to do before executing

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Tool not visible in Chat
- Confirm the server is installed and enabled via **"GitHub Copilot: Manage MCP Tools"**
- Reload VS Code window if the tool list looks stale

### Azure auth issues
- Run `az login` (or `az account set --subscription <id>`). Re-run the prompt
- Ensure your account has permissions to list/query the requested resources

### GitHub permission errors
- Verify VS Code is signed into the correct GitHub account
- Ensure repo/org access is granted; re-auth if needed

### Playwright/browser prompts
- Allow the MCP server to install required browsers. Retry the prompt

### Network/proxy limitations
- Confirm your proxy settings allow marketplace, GitHub, and Azure endpoints

## Security Considerations

- **Least privilege:** Only enable tools and scopes essential for your task
- **Review actions:** When a tool offers to create/update files or access external resources, review the plan
- **No hardcoded secrets:** Use authenticated sessions (Azure CLI, VS Code GitHub sign-in) rather than pasting tokens
- **Data handling:** Assume prompts and tool outputs can be transmitted to providers; follow your org's data policies

## 🎯 Why Choose MCP?

MCP serves as a bridge that allows language models to understand, preserve, and utilize context over time. It defines how models can:

- Use tools or long-term memory
- Maintain persistent state
- Reason across sessions
- Invoke services or functions dynamically

This makes it particularly valuable for building sophisticated applications such as:
- Multi-turn assistants
- AI copilots
- Autonomous agents

### ❌ The Problem with Traditional APIs

Conventional APIs were designed for request-response paradigms, not for language models or dynamic reasoning agents. Despite their continued strength, APIs fall short in:

- Controlling long-term memory
- Supporting multi-phase or multi-session reasoning
- Managing dynamic tool routing
- Coordinating multiple tools in an organized manner

**MCP solves these challenges** by providing a stateful, adaptable, and extensible protocol designed specifically for AI interaction patterns.
