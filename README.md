## 🔌 MCP (GitHub, Microsoft Learn, Playwright)

This track focuses on building and experimenting with **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** servers to extend GitHub Copilot with richer contextual awareness. Participants will learn how to set up MCP integrations using sources like GitHub, Microsoft Docs, and Playwright, explore practical examples, and discover "awesome Copilot" patterns that show how external tools and data can be securely exposed to Copilot to improve code generation, testing, and developer workflows.

## ⚙️ Automate Your Work (GitHub Copilot Spec Kit Lab)

In this track, teams will use **GitHub Copilot Spec Kit** to turn product ideas into working features through structured specifications. Starting from a clear problem statement, participants will define requirements, generate design artifacts, and implement a product feature with Copilot's help, showcasing how spec‑driven development can accelerate delivery, improve clarity, and align engineering output with business intent.

## 💻 Fast Prototyping – Dev/App

This hands‑on track is all about **rapidly building application prototypes** using GitHub Copilot. Participants will leverage the GitHub Copilot workshops and labs to scaffold new apps, implement APIs, add business logic, and iterate quickly on features, demonstrating how Copilot can dramatically reduce time‑to‑first‑prototype while maintaining code quality and developer flow.

**Choose your language:**

> 💻 [Start Lab - Python](tracks/dev-python.md)

> 💻 [Start Lab - .NET](tracks/dev-dotnet.md)

---

## 🏗️ Fast Prototyping – Ops/Infra

This track targets **platform engineers and DevOps practitioners** who want to move fast on infrastructure and operations. Using the same Copilot workshop labs, participants will prototype infrastructure‑as‑code, CI/CD pipelines, and operational automation, exploring how Copilot can assist with authoring, understanding, and refining scripts, templates, and configurations across cloud and platform scenarios.
